# Python-Challenge

Homework 3 Objectives: 

Background: Use concepts learned in class to complete 2 Python Challenges:
	• PyBank
	• PyPoll

1. PyBank:
	Create a python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
	Financial data found in: budget_data.csv
	Dataset is composed of 2 columns: Date & Profile/Losses

Task:
	Create a Python scrip that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
		The total number of months included in the dataset.
		The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
		Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
		The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
		The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
		Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

Example of Analysis:

Financial Analysis
---------------------
Total Months: 36
Total: $38382578
Average Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

2. PyPoll: 
	Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. 
	Data for analysis: election_data.csv 
	Composed of 3 columns: Voter ID, County, & Candidate

Task: 
	Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
		The total number of votes cast.
		A complete list of candidates who received votes.
		The percentage of votes each candidate won.
		The total number of votes each candidate won.
		The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Example of Analysis:
