# Python-Challenge
Homework 3 for data analytics bootcamp

Homework 3 Objectives: 

Background: Use concepts learned in class to complete 2 Python Challenges:
	• PyBank
	• PyPoll

	1. PyBank
    Task:
    Create a Python scrip that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
	    *The total number of months included in the dataset
	    *The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
      *Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
	    *The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	    *The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
	    *Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
	
        Example of Analysis: 
          Financial Analysis:
          ---------------------------
          Total Months: 86
          Total $38382578
          Average Change: $-2315.12
          Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
          Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167
