# Python-Challenge

## Summary
Use concepts learned in class to complete 2 Python Challenges.
* The PyBank and PyPoll folders contain separate analyses:
# 1. PyBank:
	Create a python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
	Financial data found in: budget_data.csv
	Dataset is composed of 2 columns: Date & Profile/Losses
* Task:
	Create a Python scrip that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
		The total number of months included in the dataset.
		The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
		Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
		The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
		The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
		Final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
# 2. PyPoll: 
	Tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. 
	Data for analysis: election_data.csv 
	Composed of 3 columns: Voter ID, County, & Candidate
* Task: 
	Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
